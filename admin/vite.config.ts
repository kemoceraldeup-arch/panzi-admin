 * The console's own Content-Security-Policy.
 *
 * helmet turns CSP off on the API, correctly: that process serves JSON and
 * nothing else, so a policy there would constrain documents that do not exist.
 * The policy belongs wherever the bundle is served from — which in development
 * is this dev server, and in production is whatever static host you deploy to.
 *
 * What it buys: `script-src 'self'` means a stored string that reaches the DOM
 * cannot pull in code from anywhere else, and `frame-ancestors 'none'` means
 * this console cannot be framed by a hostile page and clicked through by an
 * administrator who thinks they are pressing something else.
 *
 * `connect-src` has to name Firebase explicitly. Signing in is a call to
 * identitytoolkit and every token refresh is a call to securetoken, so a policy
 * that forgets them locks everybody out at the login screen.
